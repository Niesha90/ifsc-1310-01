        <h1> Thoughts on Web Accessibility </h1>
          <p1> My thoughts on the video that I watched was that it was very touching to see someone go through great lengths to assist someone else.
             Creating something that is bigger than you or someone else that is capable of doing normal functions, such as hovering over something, 
            something that someone else may have difficulties with. The other thing I enjoyed seeing was the dragon bar. This is a feature that can help people 
          that don't have use of their hands, can use their voice as recognition. Another thing I found interesting that he talked about is the way we make choices
        on where we decide to put images and how they impact accessibility. He goes in depth about how the contrast if too high, can impact someone that has low vision.
      If very single background is high, the webpage becomes invisible where they cannot see it. Before watching this video, and the classes that I took at Pulaski Tech,
    The way a webpage is designed in depth, especially when it came to a person that may have a disability accessing something I created, was not a second thought for me. The thrill
  of creating something that others get to browse was just as important. This video shed light that it takes a special craft to appease a larger crowd. </p1>

<h1>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h1>
<p>I can say that now looking back on graceful degradation, I can appreciate website for taking the time to build advanced browsers. There were alot of browsers
  that I remember browsing as a kid that I remember being all over the place. Being from Michigan, I'm not sure how far the website Bebo.com made it across the world, but it was a very poor website. I say that
  in comparison to other browsers. Looking at the progressive enhancement, I can say that with this being my beginning stages of this class, and not my field of work, 
  I would say that I didn't my create juices that I could have into my content. I like how they used an M&M as an example of all the layers it takes to make good content.
  Starting with the Peanut. It's a preference. 
</p>

<p>Then there's the chocolate coating. The hard candy shell, and then putting everything all together. Moral of the story, there will be different flavors that everyone will like. 
  Some will like more than others. You can decide what you present to your audience. I think if this is something that I chose to do later on down the line, 
  I hope to keep this in mind and actually try to apply this to my audience. This was a great read.

  <h2> Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
<p> This project and coming to its conclusion was quite challenging for many reasons. I haven't shared with many but before the school year started, I began having health issues. I won't divulge much into what I've experienced, but I will say that it has been challenging working full time, going to school with 6 classes full time and still trying to battle a new health condition that gradually hit me.
  I enjoyed every aspect of this web class. some parts were difficult than others. I've never used github before. While I am familiar with using a command-line based terminals, it took some getting used to. There has been nothing more gratifiying than to see your work and on a course page that you've created in a class that you did not think you would be able to keep up with.
I did chew some of the graphics from what I saw in class but I did make it into my own with my pictures and fonts. I sent my website to my sister, mom and my husband and asked for their honest feedback. My husband who has no idea about anything web-related was looking more for the grammar.
My sister, was the same. My mom, at first didn't even receive the email. I finally had to send it to another email that she does check frequently. 
 </p>
 <p>My sister surpringly pointed out that "my contact" tab disappeared while you were on the history tab. I went to check it out and low and behold it did. I've tried everything to adjust it
  I've tried to adjust the padding, the width, pixels, but I can't see to get it corrected. After multiple tries and help from the assistant instructor, I embarrassingly figured out my dilemma.
  But this was what this class was all about. Figuring out and troubleshooting issues. Something I've been doing since I was a kid. I was destined to do things like this. Overall, with the recordings available
  with the assistance available, I feel that I gained a lot from this class. I did have a web class at Pulaski tech and it was very helpful and Mr. Stafford, (I'll never forget him) was an awesome professor! 
  But this was also during a time where Covid was a thing so we were learning at home and online and it was not as extensive as this class. I am grateful for everything I've learned here. If I had to start over
  I would have tried to be a little more creative with the buttons and the features. I chose not to do this because of the time constraint that I have. I know that working full time and working and school and again the health issues, 
  I am very limited. It is a struggle to pull away and try to log on in class on Tuesday and Thursdays. But as the semester wraps up, I've made it and I would probably do it all over again, minus the health issues! 
  Thank you Prof Thomas Wallace and Prof Abdullah, you two have been great!
